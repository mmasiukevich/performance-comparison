## Goal
This test goal is to show the difference between synchronous and asynchronous interaction. For example, DB writes are slower on weaker hardware. As a result, the worker performs less useful work while waiting for a synchronous operation result. 

*As a bonus, an example of the implementation of the task on golang is given*

## Workflow
* Add 100.000 messages into RabbitMQ, each message is a command (represented by a peak on chart start);
* Received command handler opens a PostgreSQL 11 transaction, inserts an entry into DB, publishes a message (event) into RabbitMQ and commits the transaction;
* Received event does not induce any load - it is just ACKed and log message.

## Conditions
* **Intel i7 8700, 16gb DDR4, SSD** 
* All the logging is disabled;
* Every application has only 1 instance (single process);
* I haven't found how to change QoS settings in [symfony/messenger](https://github.com/symfony/messenger) so in both apps default ones are used;
* PostgreSQL 11 (500 connections limit);
* RabbitMQ 3.7.7;
* PHP 7.4;
* For [php-service-bus/service-bus](https://github.com/php-service-bus/service-bus) following PHP extensions were installed: raphf, pq, sockets, event, ext-buffer.
